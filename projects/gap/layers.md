# Geospatial layers used in density models

## Climate

- All of Diana's layers (currently using CMIJJA, DD0, DD5, EMT, MSP, CMI, TD)

## Topography

- Elevation
- Slope
- Terrain Wetness Index

## Vegetation/land cover

- NALCMS
- Continuous vegetation, tree cover (watch projection!)
- Forest height

## Disturbance

- Fire (fire year and area)
- Global Forestwatch loss layer (Albertos version, fire removed)
- Bead Linear/Polygonal disturbances

## Spatial units

- BCRs
- Ecozones (Level 1-3)
- Jurisdictions
- Brandt boreal

## Other

- Latitude
- Longitude
- Distance to road (this is optional, rarely used)
- Timezone (Jurisdiction is often enough for offsets)
